# ************************************** PROBLEM 4 **************************************

# Whatâ€™s the difference between calling the method puts and returning a value from a method?

# The method 'puts()' takes the argument inside the parenthesis and displays (returns) it to the screen.
# 'return'ing a value returns it to the method that called it without displaying it to the screen.
