# ************************************** PROBLEM 2 **************************************

# Write a method called add that takes two parameters, adds them together, and returns the result. For example, add(1, 2) should return 3.

# Then, add a line that calls your add method with two numbers of your choosing, stores the result in a variable with a name of your choosing, and then prints the result to the screen.

def addition(first_number, second_number)

  return(first_number + second_number)

end

total = addition(12, 3)

puts(total)
